Proposed working project title:
Predicting diabetes rates based on lifestyles

Brief background:
The Diabetes Health Indicators Dataset contains healthcare statistics and lifestyle survey information about people in general along with their diagnosis of diabetes. The 35 features consist of some demographics, lab test results, and answers to survey questions for each patient. The target variable for classification is whether a patient has diabetes, is pre-diabetic, or healthy.

Question:
Can we predict whether or not a patient is diabetic based on the lifestyle and healthcare statistics of the patient?

Hypothesis & Predictions:
Hypothesis: There is a connection between whether or not a patient is pre-diabetic/ diabetic and the patient's lifestyle/ healthcare statistics. 
Prediction: If a patient indicates certain lifestyle or health indications, then their doctor will have an idea of whether or not they are diabetic.
