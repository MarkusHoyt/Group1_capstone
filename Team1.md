Project Title:
Predicting Risk of Type 2 Diabetes based on National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) Questionnaire Responses

Brief background:
Our study question focuses on predicting a patient's diabetes condition from survey data. To tackle the issue of undiagnosed diabetes in the US, this question highlights the critical need for early detection and intervention. Even while the study in this area suggests that our issue may not be wholly original, it is nevertheless critical to deepen our understanding of diabetes to create more potent preventative strategies.

Question:
Can we develop a model to show the risk of Type 2 Diabetes based on information available to undiagnosed patients so that they know to visit their physician?

Hypothesis & Predictions:
Hypothesis: There is a connection between a personâ€™s responses to specific NHIS questions and whether or not they are nondiabetic or have Type 2 diabetes because there are known health and lifestyle indicators previously identified as associated with an increased risk of type 2 diabetes (Diabetes management: How lifestyle, daily routine affect blood sugar 2024).
Prediction: Based on health and lifestyle factors from the NHIS dataset, we predict that we will be able to classify whether or not a patient has Type 2 diabetes based on their responses to specific NHIS questions.


# Data Files

The CSV files were taken from https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhis/2022nhis.htm

2019 - 2022 data was used. Methodology changed between 2018 and 2019, so data from 2018 and before were not compatible with 2019-2022
